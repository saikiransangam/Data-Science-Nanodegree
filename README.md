## Project 1 - Data Science Blog
### Description:

In this project, I did the analysis of Stack Overflow Survey Data 2020. You can find my Medium Blog Post in this link for the full report.

## Project 2 - Disaster Response Pipeline
### Description:

In this project, I built a data transformation - machine learning pipeline that is capable to curate the class of the messages. The pipeline is eventually built into a flask application. The project include a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.

## Project 3 - Recommendation System
### Description:

In this project, I developed a recommendation engine's algorithm with IBM communities articles and user interactions. This project will serve as a prototype of the recommender systems of the article recommendation systems of IBM.

## Capstone Project - Spark for Big Data
### Description:

In the capstone project, I built a distributed machine learning for a user log using spark - the big data technology toolkit. The primary objective was to predict the churning possibilities of every user.
